.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ballerburg is a castle combat game. Two players (which can be human or
computer-controlled) try to destroy the opponent's castle with their cannons.

There are two ways to win the game: Either by directly hitting the opponents
king with a cannonball, or by destroying enough of the opponents commodities
so that the king capitulates automatically.
